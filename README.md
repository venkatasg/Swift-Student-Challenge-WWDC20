# Text Analysis Playground

This contains my Swift Playground submission for the [Swift Student
Challenge](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc20/swift-student-challenge/) at
[WWDC 2020](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc20/). To interact with the
playground, simply open the `.playground` file in Xcode.

**Note**: I created my playground on Xcode 11.4.1 on macOS 10.15.4. While the
playground does run on the [Swift Playgrounds
app](https://www.apple.com/swift/playgrounds/) for iPad and Mac, some of the
output look weird in the app. I would recommend running my playground on Xcode.
